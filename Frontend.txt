    1. Minimize HTTP requests by bundling and minifying assets (CSS, JS).

    .
    
    2. Implement lazy loading for images and non-critical resources.

    3. Use caching techniques (browser caching, server-side caching) to reduce server load.

    4. Optimize database queries with proper indexing and efficient querying techniques.

    5. Compress and optimize images to reduce file size without losing quality.
     
    6. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for large datasets.

    .
    
    7. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets from geographically distributed servers.
    
    8. Minimize the use of blocking JavaScript and prioritize asynchronous operations.
